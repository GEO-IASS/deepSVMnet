# deepSVMnet
Training deep rectified linear support vector machine (SVM) networks using a novel back sign signal propagation (BSSP) learning algorithm

You need TensorFlow to access the MNIST dataset or you can provide the MNIST loader yourself.
The code is built from ground up with Python and Numpy.
Run the svm_net_xor.py for testing the algorithm on the XOR problem
Run mnist_recognizer.py to train on the MNIST dataset
